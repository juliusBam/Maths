# Maths
Repos for different mathematical calculations in python.
Here there are some basics python scripts I am making to learn python and make my life easier calculating some general maths stuffs. I know you can use octave for 99% of the operations I am making here, but I thought it could be nice to share sore code anyway. If you have suggestions about new operations to add, or some improvements of my code feel free to comment so we can have a nice chat!
